:: Chapter 3

Monday.

You don't go into work today. How could you? You're too excited. You lie in bed.

At 10 AM, your boss texts you about your deadlines.

You tell him to fuck off, you quit. Oh god, it feels so fucking good. (reuse the text widget from LoTP)

You didn't have a lot of money when you needed to live for another month, but now that you don't plan to survive past this week, it's like you have a TON of money.

:: Splurge on delivery.

6 PM you order yourself a shit ton of expensive takeout, just blowing all your savings.

Driver knocks on your door. It's a squirrel girl named Piper. She's trembling and is so fucking relieved that just this once you're not someone who's trying to eat them. She comments that your place is pretty big for a bunny. Yeah, you used to live with a saint bernard. Oh, she says, a little 

You're still powertripping, so you offer her $2000 to skip the rest of their deliveries and hang out with you and get drunk. They think you're cute, and accept. You both feast on the remaining doordash orders.

This rules.

You message Selkie and say you made a friend and you're having a great time. She asks if you're having second thoughts about killing yourself. No no, you still are gonna do that.

You take a selfie with your friend and send it along. She teases you both and says she's open to eating you both. Doordasher says they can't, they have to work tomorrow.

You snuggle or fuck and fall asleep. You pass out, and wake up a hours later and they're gone. They leave a note about how they had fun but are uncomfortable that you're friends with predators.

You confide in Selkie about being a little hurt by this rejection.
